<p>"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</br>
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making </br>
it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney </br>
College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from </br>
a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, </br>
discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 </br>
of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. </br>
This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first </br>
line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32."
